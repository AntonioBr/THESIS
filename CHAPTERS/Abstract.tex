The aim of this thesis is to design, develop and validate an innovative Reinforcement Learning based approach for global optimization of black-box expensive functions.
First, the methodological background of Reinforcement Learning and an analysis of the literature is reported. Then, a detailed description of the proposed approach, which is based on the SARSA algorithm, is detailed along with with results obtained on a set of test functions. A preliminary comparison between the policies/strategies learned by the SARSA agent and typical acquisition functions from the Bayesian Optimization framework is reported. Finally, the learned policies/strategies are compared with the "human brain approach" adopted by a sample of people who has tried to optimize the same set of black-box test functions.
