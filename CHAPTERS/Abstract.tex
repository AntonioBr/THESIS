The aim of this thesis is to provide an innovative, Reinforcement Learning based, approach for the optimization of black-box functions. First, the methodological background of Reinforcement Learning and an analysis of the literature is reported. Then, a detailed description of the design, development and validation of the proposed approach, which is based on the SARSA algorithm, is proposed, with results obtained on a set of test functions. A preliminary comparison between the policies learned through SARSA and typical acquisition functions from Bayesian Optimization is reported. Finally, the learned policies are compared with the "human brain approach" adopted by a sample of people who has tried to optimize the same black-box multi-dimensional test functions.
